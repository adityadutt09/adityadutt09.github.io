title: "Research Experience"

Research has played a strong role in my undergraduate program as I have been performing undergraduate research since Sophomore year. It has taught me a lot about the current fields of interest in the academic world and has led me to appreciate and become passionatie about performing research in some of these fields. 

In my first year as an undergraduate, I was interested in a lot of fields from Machine Learning to Virtual Reality. As such, I wanted to explore all of these fields as much as possible. 


My first ever research experience, although short-lived, was an eye-opening one. I worked for as little as 2 months at a lab called the [Virtual Education and Research Lab]({% link http://verl.npre.illinois.edu/default.html}) where students performed collaborative research on implementing educational modules for Nuclear Engineering through Virtual and Augmented Reality. This experience showed me how powerful virtual platforms are and also taught me the basics of how to create such games on Unity. 

My second research experience was a year later, in the form of an Independent Study under Prof. Nikhil Admal, where I studied about the applications of machine learning in the area grain boundary evolution. This was a longer, much more technical research as I was tasked with a lot of literature review and technical writing throughout my study. Along the way, I learnt the foundational concepts of Neural Networks and how they are implemented using TensorFlow. I also learnt about the concepts behind grain boundaries and their evolution. 

This study was a realstic insight into the research world as it showed me how much effort goes into constructing new problems and coming up with their solutions. Towards the end of the study, I was reaching a point where I could not progress because of outdated documentation and advanced skills that I did not possess. However, I did manage to write up a technical report about the concepts of Neural networks and their application to Grain Boundaries that you can read [here]({% link \Artificial_Neural_Networks.pdf%}).
