<!-- Research has played a strong role in my undergraduate program as I have been performing undergraduate research since Sophomore year. It has taught me a lot about the current fields of interest in the academic world and has led me to appreciate and become passionatie about performing research in some of these fields. 

## 1. Virtual Reality for Education (Feb 2020 - Mar 2020)
In my first year as an undergraduate, I was interested in a lot of fields from Machine Learning to Virtual Reality. As such, I wanted to explore all of these fields as much as possible. 

My first ever research experience, although short-lived, was an eye-opening one. I worked for as little as 2 months at a lab called the [Virtual Education and Research Lab](http://verl.npre.illinois.edu/default.html) where students performed collaborative research on implementing educational modules for Nuclear Engineering through Virtual and Augmented Reality. This experience showed me how powerful virtual platforms are and also taught me the basics of how to create such games on Unity. 

## 2. Independent Study (Jan 2021 - August 2021)
### Research Mentor: Prof. Nikhil Admal, Dept of Material Science and Engineering (MATSE), UIUC
My second research experience was a year later, in the form of an Independent Study under Prof. Nikhil Admal, where I studied about the applications of machine learning in the area grain boundary evolution. This was a longer, much more technical research as I was tasked with a lot of literature review and technical writing throughout my study. Along the way, I learnt the foundational concepts of Neural Networks and how they are implemented using TensorFlow. I also learnt about the concepts behind grain boundaries and their evolution. 

This study was a realstic insight into the research world as it showed me how much effort goes into constructing new problems and coming up with their solutions. Towards the end of the study, I was reaching a point where I could not progress because of outdated documentation and advanced skills that I did not possess. However, I did manage to write up a technical report about the concepts of Neural networks and their application to Grain Boundaries that you can read [here]({% link Artificial_Neural_Networks.pdf %}).

## 3. VR Immersive Learning Lab (Aug 2021 - Dec 2021)
### Research Mentor: Prof. Raluca Ilie, Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), UIUC
After my independent study I took part in a research project in the [Immersive Learning Lab](https://www.ilie.ece.illinois.edu/immersive-learning-lab) housed by the ECE Department. This research project was much more hands-on and application based than theoretical and allowed me to explore my creative side as well. I was tasked to find a way to explain the Laplace Equation on Parallel-Plate capacitors through Virtual Reality in Unity. The idea was to help undergrads in ECE taking the introductory Fields and Waves class to get a more immersive experience taught in lecture by providing a more visual experience through VR and the power of the Oculus Quest. 

This project was extremely fun and interesting as it not only improved my coding skills but also taught me a lot about game design and development as well as the fundamental ideas behind creating a virtual immersive environment.
